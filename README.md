## simple faces
My first project is going to draw simple faces using cairo

The rules are:
* faces are ellipsoid and max to 60x100
* faces can be any color
* 2 eyes are drawn at 1/3 from the top of the face
* eyes will be centered and apart by 1/3 of the face
* eyes are white
* no hair
* 1 type of nose: square
* mouth is ellipsoid
* mouth is black

generation takes place in the:
* face colour
* face size / shape
